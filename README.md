# Predict-Bike-Sharing-Demand-with-AutoGluon
Udacity AWS Machine Learning Fundamentals Nanodegree Program Project 1. 
(Train a model using AutoGluon to predict bike sharing demand, and see how highly you can place in the competition! ) \
In this project, I used the AutoGluon library to train multiple models for the Bike Sharing Demand Kaggle competition. The goal was to leverage Tabular Prediction to fit data from the provided CSV files and optimize the model's performance.

## Usage
To run this project:
- Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Asma-Nasr/Predict-Bike-Sharing-Demand-with-AutoGluon.git
```
